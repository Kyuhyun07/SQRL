Description: This package includes functions to fit quantiles regression models for censored residual lifetimes. It provides various options for regression parameters estimation: the induced smoothing approach (smooth), and L1-minimization (non-smooth).  It also implements the estimation methods for standard errors of the regression parameters estimates based on an efficient partial multiplier bootstrap method and robust sandwich estimator. Furthermore, a simulataneous procedure of estimating regression parameters and their standard errors via an iteratively updating procedure is implemented (iterative).
