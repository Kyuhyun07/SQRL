Description: This package includes functions to estimate quantiles regression estimator of residual lifetime or failure time. It provides various options to estimate: the quantile regression estimator using induced smoothing approach(smooth), L1-minimization (non-smooth), and iterative procedure (iterative). Furthermore, it implements the methodology to estimate standard error of estimator based on efficient partial multiplier bootstrap method and robust sandwich estimator.
